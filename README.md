## Khan IT Website – Frontend Task

This project is a static landing page built from a provided Figma design using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript only.

The goal was to recreate the first few sections of the Khan IT website with a focus on pixel accuracy, responsiveness, clean structure, and proper UI behavior — without using any JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, or Next.js.
